							<tr><td>001.<audio src="audio5/001.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What kinds of weather can affect flight safety?
thunderstorms, hurricane, typhoon, strong wind, wind shear, haze, hail, snow, icing, low 
visibility, fog, lightning(strike)…

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>002.<audio src="audio5/002.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Have you ever encountered turbulence during the flight?
 When? Where?
 I encountered severe turbulence at the flight level…
 it’s hard to control the aircraft/ maintain the attitude of the a/c. The speed and altitude 
changed rapidly/ suddenly.
 (several passengers got injured.)
 I reported the situation to ATC and requested to change the altitude/flight level/ course 
to leave the turbulent area as soon as possible.
 Student pilot: Once I encountered moderate turbulence in a local flight Training. On final, 
I encountered moderate turbulence. It was hard to control the a/c. the speed and altitude 
changed suddenly.
Luckily, I got control of the aircraft. And then reported the situation to ATC and made a safe 
landing.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>003.<audio src="audio5/003.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Why do you think turbulence is dangerous to flight safety? 
 Because it is hard/difficult to control the a/c in severe turbulence. The a/c may lose 
speed and altitude rapidly. Severe turbulence may even cause structural damage and 
passenger injuries.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>004.<audio src="audio5/004.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Besides turbulence, what other bad weather affect flight safety?
 Many bad weather conditions may affect flight safety such as wind shear, thunderstorm, 
heavy rain, hail, icing, heavy snow, sandstorm, hailstorm, volcanic ashes, lightning strike, 
typhoon and so on.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>005.<audio src="audio5/005.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What are your suggestions about reducing risks of incidents caused by dangerous weather? / how can the pilots avoid turbulence/bad weather?
it’s necessary to make weather analysis before each flight.
 As a pilot, I’ll try to avoid the dangerous weather. 
 We should make good preflight preparation. Before departure, get to know weather 
information, for example, listen to ATIS, if there’s bad weather in the vicinity of the 
airport, delay takeoff or request changing the runway. During cruising, monitor radar or 
reports from other aircraft, if there’s bad weather ahead, request to change flight level 
or deviation to avoid the weather.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>006.<audio src="audio5/006.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If a passenger is seriously injured in the turbulence in flight, what will you do?
 I think I need to make an announcement to see if there’s a doctor on board, at the same 
time, ask flight attendants to give first aid to the passenger, inform ATC of our situation. 
If the injured passenger is in critical condition, I may declare medical emergency, request 
landing at the nearest suitable airport, request radar vector and medical services like 
ambulance on arrival.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>007.<audio src="audio5/007.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Why is lightning dangerous to flight safety? / What damages may lightning strike cause to the aircraft?
 It may cause damages to the a/c, such as structural damage, system failure, engine 
flameout and so on.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>008.<audio src="audio5/008.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> In what kind of weather conditions does lightning most likely occur?
 Lightning strikes more likely occur in thunderstorms, CBs and buildups.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>009.<audio src="audio5/009.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If your aircraft was struck by lightning in flight what would you do?
 we’ll check the aircraft status. It may cause system failure. For example, if the 
communication system fails, we follow filed flight plan, then reset transponder code to 
7600 and make a blind transmission. If navigation system fails, we’ll call ATC, request 
radar vector, use traditional navigation sensors/ backup instruments to report positions.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>010.<audio src="audio5/010.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What can pilots do to avoid lightning strike?
 First we check the latest weather, check the weather radar screen and monitor the 
cloud movement and trend; if there’s any indication of thunderstorms , we request 
deviation/offset or maneuver around the weather.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>011.<audio src="audio5/011.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> How do you search for CBs during flight?
 during flight, we use weather radar to search for CB. If there’s CB, it shows in red on 
radar screen. Use visual observation and previous pilot’s report.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>012.<audio src="audio5/012.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What damages might CBs bring to your aircraft?
 the a/c may encounter lightning strike and severe turbulence. It may cause damages to the a/c, such as structural damage, system failure, engine flameout and so on.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>013.<audio src="audio5/013.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Besides CBs, are there any other adverse weather conditions that affect our flight 
safety?
thunderstorms, hurricane, typhoon, strong wind, wind shear, haze, hail, snow, icing, low 
visibility, fog, lightning(strike)…

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>014.<audio src="audio5/014.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Which weather condition do you think is the most dangerous to fly in?
 I think wind shear is the most dangerous weather. Wind shear may cause the a/c to 
change speed and altitude quickly and suddenly, so pilots have no enough time and 
altitude to make response. (perform wind shear recovery procedures./ take actions). 
Wind shear makes the a/c difficult to control, causes stall or even crash.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>015.<audio src="audio5/015.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Do you think weather is a major factor concerning flight safety?
 Many weather conditions may affect flight safety, such as thunderstorms, typhoon, 
strong wind, wind shear, and so on. A lot of accidents are caused by dangerous weather, 
like thunderstorms, strong wind, lightning. If the aircraft flies into the bad weather, it 
may suffer severe turbulence, even structural damage or stall. 
 A lot of accidents are caused by the pilots taking off or landing under marginal weather 
conditions.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>016.<audio src="audio5/016.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> How do you make a weather analysis before each flight?
 we analyze the data concerning the weather, including weather on departure and arrival 
airport, weather en route and alternate. We review different kinds of flying at current 
weather conditions. 
 For example, before departure, if the visibility is below company minima, we have to 
request delay departure.
 If the crosswind is marginal before departure, we should review rejected takeoff 
procedure.
 Another example, We study at what point or flight level we may encounter bad weather 
like CB, thunderstorm, we need to prepare for offset or level change.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>017.<audio src="audio5/017.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What should flight crew pay attention to when they encounter strong crosswind during 
landing?
 We should make sure that the aircraft is on the correct glide slope and localizer
 We should avoid the risks of incidents caused by tail strike.
 We should avoid veering off the runway.
 Because there might be wind shear, we should be prepared for going around.
 We should also pay special attention to the operational minimum, the crosswind can’t 
exceed the limitation. 
 We should monitor ATIS, especially wind information, like the change of wind speed 
and wind direction.
 We use rudder pedal and control sticks to adjust the direction, try to keep direction 
along the r/w centerline.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>018.<audio src="audio5/018.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If you know there is a strong crosswind at the destination airport, what should you be 
careful about?
 I’ll keep monitoring the weather forecast at the destination airport, especially wind 
information. If the wind data is below operational minima, we should be prepared for 
diversion to the alternate airport.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>019.<audio src="audio5/019.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If you notice the crosswind exceeds the limitation, but your captain or first officer insists in landing, what will you do?
I think good communication among the crew members is always necessary. 
We should have discussion first, it can help us make right judgment. 
Then we should check the operational manual to make sure the crosswind doesn’t 
exceed the company’s limitation.
Finally the captain makes the decision.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>020.<audio src="audio5/020.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If the previous aircraft goes around due to crosswind, what will you do?
 The previous aircraft goes around, it doesn’t mean have to go around as well. We must 
closely monitor wind speed and wind direction, since wind can be very changeable. If the 
wind data is within limits at the minimum altitude, we can continue approach. At the 
same time, we should pay special attention to the possible wind shear. If the wind shear 
warning is triggered, or crosswind exceeds our company’s limits, we’ll go around (carry 
out missed approach procedure) or change another runway.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>021.<audio src="audio5/021.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Do you think crosswind landing is very dangerous? Why?
Crosswind landing is dangerous, because it may lead to tail strike or cause the aircraft to 
veer off the runway. 
If the pilot cannot properly control the attitude, the aircraft may suffer from overload on 
the landing gear. / cause hard landing 
Because of big angle during landing, it may cause the wingtips or engines to hit the 
ground.
If the bank angle exceeds limits, it will be recorded in QAR. The pilot must make report 
after flight.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>022.<audio src="audio5/022.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If crosswind is close to your standard, / if crosswind is marginal around your standard, what will you do?
 If there is crosswind during taxi, we’ll adjust the aircraft direction, try to align the 
aircraft nose with taxiway centerline.
 If crosswind is marginal before takeoff, we’ll be prepared to reject takeoff when the 
wind data is over limits.
 If crosswind is marginal before landing, we’ll confirm if crosswind is within limits and be 
prepared to go around or divert to a suitable alternate airport.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>023.<audio src="audio5/023.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Can you land an aircraft in a tailwind？
It depends. If the tailwind is within the limit, we’ll continue approach, but if the tailwind 
exceeds the limits, we cannot make a landing. We may decide to go around or divert to 
another airport.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>024.<audio src="audio5/024.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What is tailwind landing limitation of your type of aircraft?
I fly B737, the tailwind limitation for my aircraft is below 10 knots.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>025.<audio src="audio5/025.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What would you do if the tailwind is too strong?
Before departure, we’ll monitor wind data, if it’s over the limitation, we’ll request delay 
departure or change the runway. Before landing, we’ll keep monitoring wind 
information. If it’s over the limitation, we’ll go around. If not, we’ll continue approach.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>026.<audio src="audio5/026.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Do you think it is dangerous to land an aircraft in a heavy rain?
Yes. Heavy rain may lower the visibility. The pilot may not be able to see the runway at 
the minimum altitude. The runway surface may become wet because of heavy rain. As a 
result, braking action may be poor. The aircraft may overrun the runway.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>027.<audio src="audio5/027.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What should you consider during landing in a rain?
 We should consider visibility, runway conditions, braking action.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>028.<audio src="audio5/028.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Do you have any alternate airport planned for each flight? Why?
 Yes. In case there is bad weather or mechanical problems en route, the crew can not continue the flight to the destination, so they have to make a plan for alternate airports 
before the flight.
 we’re not sure if we can make a landing at destination airport for every flight 
because we may encounter many abnormal situations, like bad weather, aircraft 
problems, system failure, passenger problems，military activities, airport closure.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>029.<audio src="audio5/029.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What information do you need to know about your alternate airport before diversion?
 weather information, airport facilities, runway conditions, ATIS.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>030.<audio src="audio5/030.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What kinds of support do you usually need from ATC if you want to make a diversion?
 Pilots should Inform ATC, report their intention and present situation. ATC provide 
information about alternate airport, offer navigation/radar vector to the airport. In case 
of emergency, ATC will help coordinate with the relevant departments. (can activate 
emergency procedures and provide the aircraft assistance)

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>031.<audio src="audio5/031.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What preparations are needed before you divert to your alternate airport?
 we should make decision first. We choose the best alternate airport and change flight 
plan. we need to get the information about the alternate airport, like weather conditions, 
airport facilities, runway conditions. We should contact ATC for clearance and notify ATC 
of our position, reasons for diversion and intention. We need to contact our company’s 
dispatch. It’s necessary to make a PA to inform the passengers of diversion.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>032.<audio src="audio5/032.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What factors will you consider when you decide to divert or return?
 There are many factors, such as fuel on board, ground services, endurance, runway 
condition, maintenance capability, dispatch services

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>033.<audio src="audio5/033.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Who do you need to contact in case of diversion?
 We should contact ATC for clearance and notify ATC of our position, reasons for 
diversion and intention. We need to contact our company’s dispatch.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>034.<audio src="audio5/034.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> When making the decision to divert if you have a different opinion from your captain or FO, what will you do?
 Communication is necessary between captain and FO. So the crew need to have a 
discussion in order to make a right decision/ a good judgment before diversion.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>035.<audio src="audio5/035.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If there are some complaints among the passengers about the diversion, what can you do to comfort them?
 The pilots usually do not have enough time to make an announcement, especially during 
approach, so they ask the purser to deal with that. Inform the passengers of the 
reasons for diversion.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>036.<audio src="audio5/036.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What situations can cause delays?
There are many reasons for delays, such as bad weather, ground services, military 
activities, air flow control, mechanical trouble and so on. I think bad weather conditions 
is a major cause of delay. Ground services like de-icing, refueling, baggage handling, 
cargo loading is also common reason for delay.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>037.<audio src="audio5/037.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Do long delays occur more frequently at big airports?
 Yes. There are more planes at big airports, so air traffic at big airports is much busier. As 
a result, air flow control occurs more often. Pilots often have to wait for a long time.
 at big airports, there are many taxiways, sometimes it takes a long time for taxiing. 
Another problem is security, it may take a long time to go through the security, so 
passengers may be late for boarding.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>038.<audio src="audio5/038.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> How do you think we can reduce delays?
In my opinion, there are several ways to reduce delays. 
I think ground staff should improve their work efficiency, like refueling, baggage handling, 
cargo loading. 
I think ATC should use RVSM to improve route efficiency 
Airports can build more runway.
We can open more airspace for civil flights
Good communication between the pilots and ATC or the ground can help reduce flight 
delays.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>039.<audio src="audio5/039.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What do you think of/about airlines compensating passengers after long delays?
 If the delay is caused by airlines, such as mechanical trouble, aircraft dispatch problems, 
poor management, and so on, I think it is necessary to compensate. It can help airlines 
do their job better in reducing delays.
 (Build up good public image)
 On the other hand, if the delay is caused by situations beyond airlines’ control, such as 
bad weather, military activities, etc., I don’t think airlines need to compensate.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>040.<audio src="audio5/040.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Have you ever experienced long delays? Can you tell me something about your longest delays? When and where? What was the reason?
 Yes, of course. Flight delays are very common, especially in summer. 
 I remember the longest delay I experienced was 3 hours. It was last winter when I flew 
from Beijing to Shenyang. Because of heavy snow, Beijing airport was closed. We had to 
wait until the airport was open.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>041.<audio src="audio5/041.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Do you often encounter traffic flow control ?
 Yes. Especially at big airports. At big airports, there’re many aircraft departing and 
arriving. Traffic is quite busy and airspace becomes congested, as a result, we often 
encounter traffic flow control.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>042.<audio src="audio5/042.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> In what airports are you more likely to encounter flow control?
 There are three kinds of airports. First is big and busy airports, such as … second kind is 
airports where bad weather is frequent. Third kind is airports where you often encounter 
military activities.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>043.<audio src="audio5/043.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What may be some reasons for flow control?
 Bad weather, military activities, VIP flights, limited airspace, prohibited area

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>044.<audio src="audio5/044.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> In flight, if ATC informs you that they receive an anonymous call saying there’s a bomb on board your aircraft, what would you do?
 If my a/c is on the ground, request security staff to deal with it, then deplane the 
passengers. If my a/c is in the air, I’ll declare the emergency, complete the checklist, 
notify the cabin crew, ask the chief purser to look for the suspected article, and request
landing at the nearest airport. Before landing request emergency services and parking at 
the apron, prepare for emergency evacuation. After landing carry out emergency 
evacuation and request ground assistance.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>045.<audio src="audio5/045.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Does your company have any specific procedures about a bomb situation?
 Yes. In case of a bomb on board situation, the flight crew should report to company’s 
operational department. If the aircraft is on the ground, the crew should deplane 
passengers immediately. If it occurs during flight, the crew should follow SOP, descend 
to a safe altitude and request landing as soon as possible. At the same time, ask the 
flight attendants to keep the passengers away from the suspicious article or bomb.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>046.<audio src="audio5/046.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What systems does your aircraft have?
 There are many systems, such as hydraulic system, pressurization system, electrical 
system, air-conditioning system, navigation system, communication system, etc.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>047.<audio src="audio5/047.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Do you have pressurization system on the aircraft? Why do you need pressurization system on the aircraft?
My aircraft has pressurization system. As altitude increases, both pressure and oxygen 
will reduce. If the a/c flies over 4000m, the a/c needs to be pressurized. The 
pressurization system can provide necessary oxygen and keep cabin pressure, so that 
the passengers can breathe normally. pressurization system can help pilots fly at higher altitudes and overcome the effects of 
hypoxia. Without the oxygen, pilots may become incapacitated.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>048.<audio src="audio5/048.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>  What may cause in-flight depressurization?
There are many reasons for in-flight depressurization, such as structural damage and 
pressurization system failure. (bird strike, lightning strike, severe turbulence, bomb 
explosion, air-conditioning system failure.)

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>049.<audio src="audio5/049.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> In your opinion which is more dangerous, slow depressurization or rapid depressurization? 
At high level, Rapid depressurization is more dangerous than slow…because the 
rapid… may cause the a/c to lose oxygen and cause pilots to lose consciousness in a
short time. 
we have no enough time to make response. If we don’t put on oxygen mask in time, we 
may become incapacitated in a short time.
Slow … is more dangerous, because it’s hard to be detected. When the pilots discover 
the problem, it’s already too late.
 It occurs very slowly. The pilot may suffer from hypoxia without even noticing it. And 
hypoxia may cause the pilot to make wrong decisions.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>050.<audio src="audio5/050.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What are the procedures to deal with rapid depressurization? / In case of rapid 
depressurization, what are your standard operation procedures?
 Put on oxygen masks, establish inner communication, check cabin altitude. Immediately 
Descend to below 10000ft, set transponder code to 7700. If it is out of control, the 
captain declares emergency descent, turn right 30 degrees and execute emergency 
descent, switch on pax oxygen, make a distress call to ATC, carry out the checklist. Return or divert to the nearest airport.
