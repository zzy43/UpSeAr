							<tr><td>251.<audio src="audio5/251.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>  Can you give some examples of human errors which can largely endanger flight safety? 
 For example, there’s a typical case caused by human errors, Yichun Accident. Because 
the pilot didn’t strictly follow the regulation, the aircraft crashed. The weather was 
below minimum. Instead of going around, the pilot still continued to make approach and 
landing. So the a/c crashed on the mountain. 
 for example, Flight 235 from Fuxing Airlines, right after takeoff, during climb, one of the 
engine( starboard/right engine ) flamed out, but the captain shut the port engine 
because he made the wrong judgement, which caused crash.
							
</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>252.<audio src="audio5/252.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What can we do to reduce the human errors to minimum in flight operations?
 Strictly follow SOP and regulations of my company.
Follow SOP, Use standard call among crew members, Carry out crosscheck, Perform 
checklist, Make flight briefing, Readback instructions

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>253.<audio src="audio5/253.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Are you familiar with the job of cabin crew? / Do you think a pilot should be familiar with 
how flight attendants work in the cabin?/ do you think a pilot should know something 
about flight attendants’ work in the cabin?
 Yes, I think so. Because the pilots and the flight attendants work as a team during the 
flight. Good cooperation helps ensure flight safety.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>254.<audio src="audio5/254.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>How do you cooperate with the cabin crew in flight? / How can pilots work together with 
cabin crew to ensure flight safety? /Do you think the captain’s briefing with the cabin 
crew should be mandatory?
 Before each flight, the captain has to brief the cabin crew and discussed the flight plan. 
During flight, if there’s bad weather en route, the pilots should inform the cabin in time, 
so they may stop serving or let the passengers return to their seats and fasten their belts. 
it’s important for flight safety.
During pre-flight preparation, all the crew members get to know each other. The captain 
should brief all the crew members about weather, flight plan, the do’s and don’ts.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>255.<audio src="audio5/255.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>How could the cabin crew provide support to the pilot in the emergency situation? Why is cabin crew important in dealing with emergency situations?
What should pilots do to coordinate with cabin crew in emergency situation?
 Flight attendants should keep monitoring anything abnormal in the cabin, like fluid 
leaking, smoke, fire, strange noise. If anything abnormal occurs, inform the pilots right 
away. This helps pilots make right decision.
 For example, in case of emergency evacuation, pilots should brief the cabin on how to 
prepare the evacuation and direction for evacuation. Then the cabin share the tasks.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>256.<audio src="audio5/256.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Do you have emergency training together with the cabin?
 Yes. Cabin crew and cockpit crew perform the emergency training together once a year.
 we practice procedures of emergency evacuation.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>257.<audio src="audio5/257.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Do you think it’s necessary to minimize crew communication in approach phase?
 According to the regulation and operational manual, below 10000 feet, flight crew 
cannot talk about anything which is not related to flight operations. During approach, 
the crews have lots of tasks, like doing the checklists, communicating with ATC, 
preparing for landing. But sometimes crew communication is still necessary . For 
example, if the captain makes decision, he should inform first officer immediately. If the 
weather is below minimum, the flight crew should have discussion and the captain 
makes decision.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>258.<audio src="audio5/258.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>How should the pilots cooperate with each other before departure?
How should flight crew members (PF and PM) share tasks at different stages of the flight?
For example, during preflight stage, captain does the cockpit check and FO monitors 
refueling. They both do the walk-around inspection.
For example, before takeoff, pilots receive approval from ATC for entering the runway, PM 
read back the instructions and do the checklist. PF controls the aircraft, at that time, PM 
turns on TCAS, informs cabin crew, monitor instruments and the aircraft.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>259.<audio src="audio5/259.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> In abnormal situation, what’s the task-sharing like among the flight crew?
 At ground operations, FO does the checklist and the captain confirms. During cruising, in 
normal situations, PF controls the aircraft and monitors PM’s actions. PM does the 
checklist, does the radio and performs the procedures. In abnormal situations, the 
captain will take control.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>260.<audio src="audio5/260.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Do you think it’s necessary to carry out cross-check? Why?
 Yes. when there isn’t checklist to follow, it’s very necessary to carry out cross-check. 
Cross check is the best way to reduce human errors and improve flight safety.
 When changing the altitude, it’s necessary to do cross check. For example, ATC gives 
the instruction: descend to 7500m. PM does the readback: 7500m. Then PF does the 
readback again and adjusts the altitude to 7500m. Then PM must confirm again the 
altitude. PF execute this instruction. This cross-check is very important for flight safety. If 
one pilot makes mistake, for example, set the altitude to 5700m, the other pilot can find 
it out quickly and make correction.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>261.<audio src="audio5/261.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Have you ever had CRM training? How often?
Yes. CRM training is an important part of our regular training program. We have CRM training 
twice a year.
Our airline doesn’t provide specific CRM training courses, but we practice that in the 
simulator or during flight.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>262.<audio src="audio5/262.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What topics do you discuss during CRM training? Give me one or two examples.
We have ground courses and simulator training.
CRM training is an essential part in the simulator. In simulator training, two pilots will work 
together to practice SOP, standard callout, checklists and so on.
Ground courses include theories, case studies (incident and accident analysis) , group 
discussion and so on. pilots talk about the different situations they encounter during 
flight, so that pilots can learn from each other.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>263.<audio src="audio5/263.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Does your Airline provide joint CRM training for flight crew and cabin crew? What drills 
do you do? Give me one or two examples.
Yes. an important part of joint CRM training is emergency evacuation.
In this training, pilots can learn how to have good communication and cooperation in case of 
emergency.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>264.<audio src="audio5/264.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Who else do you think should be included in a joint CRM training? Why?
I think controllers should be included in a joint CRM training. (It’s necessary to involve 
controllers in our joint training) because face to face communication can help us have a 
better understanding of each other’s work.
For example, in case of flight delays, pilots may become quite stressful and anxious. If the 
controllers are not familiar with pilots’ working procedures and don’t give pilots enough 
time to prepare for departure, it may cause pilots’ mistakes, which will bring potential 
risks.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>265.<audio src="audio5/265.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Do you think joint CRM training is an effective way to improve flight safety? Why?
Yes, I think so. Joint CRM training helps pilots and flight attendants be familiar with 
procedures of emergency evacuation. Both pilots and flight attendants can improve 
their abilities in communication, coordination and decision-making. In case of emergency 
evacuation, they can make quick response and have good teamwork, which will increase 
the safety margin.
 In August, 2016, a Boeing 737-800 from China Airlines was on fire and exploded during 
landing, luckily, all onboard passengers and crew members successfully evacuated the 
aircraft in 94 seconds. I think this successful emergency evacuation is because the 
airline provides effective CRM training to pilots and flight attendants.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>266.<audio src="audio5/266.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> How do pilots cooperate with ATC controllers in maintaining flight safety?/ How do you 
cooperate with ATC to ensure flight safety?
We should follow controller’s instructions, for the key information, we must do the 
readback. When unsure of the clearance, we need to confirm with ATC.
In case of emergency, pilots report to ATC their situation and intentions, declare 
emergency if necessary, ATC will help pilots coordinate with the relevant department 
and provide ground assistance. 
I think cooperation between pilots and ATC is very important. Controllers provide 
ground support for pilots to achieve flight safety. They can give pilots useful information, 
such as heading, flight level, speed and so on. For example, if they find conflicting traffic 
on their radar, they will direct the aircraft to avoid collision. Pilots should follow ATC’s 
instructions. Whenever the problem occurs, the pilots should contact ATC and tell ATC 
the nature of their problem and their intentions. Controllers can offer assistance, such as 
ambulance or fire trucks.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>267.<audio src="audio5/267.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Are there some suggestions or recommendations to ATC from a pilot point of view? / 
What are your suggestions for ATC? /
 Controllers should monitor radar and get detailed information of every a/c in his 
controlled area. Follow RVSM regulations.
 Over the terminal airspace, workload becomes heavier for both pilots and controllers, 
especially for controllers. They should change shift every hour.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>268.<audio src="audio5/268.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What is situational awareness?
During flight, the pilots should know his own position (who I am and where I am) and 
know the positions of other a/c.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>269.<audio src="audio5/269.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Why is situational awareness important?
What might happen if you lose situational awareness? Can loss of situational 
awareness lead to accidents? And why?
Yes. Situational awareness is very important. If pilots lose situational awareness 
during flight, he may not be aware of his a/c’s position relative to other a/c, which 
may cause serious consequences, like flying into terrain, a/c conflicts, ground collision, 
mid-air collision, runway incursion.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>270.<audio src="audio5/270.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Would you give some suggestions to pilots to improve their situational awareness?
Pilots should monitor frequency during flight. If there is no transmission received for 
15 minutes, pilots must contact ATC and do radio check.
