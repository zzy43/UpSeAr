							<tr><td>201.<audio src="audio5/201.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>  What human factors may affect good communication?
 if pilots and controllers can use good communication skills, for example, speak clearly, 
use standard phraseology, readback key information, communication will go on 
smoothly. 
 during approach phrase, since pilots have a lot of tasks, it’s necessary to minimize crew 
communication for safety, for example, ATC should not give too much message or cabin 
crew should not distract pilots’ attention by asking questions. 
 if one aircraft occupies the frequency for too long, it will affect other aircraft to have 
effective communication with ATC.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>202.<audio src="audio5/202.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What environment factors may affect effective communication?
 If the communication equipment doesn’t work properly, it will affect communication.
 Try to avoid the mountains. If the a/c flies at low altitude, it may affect the quality of 
radio communication, 
 Bad weather, like thunderstorm or lightning may affect communicaiton.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>203.<audio src="audio5/203.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> How do pilots make a distress transmitting?
We’ll call MAYDAY three times, describe our emergency situation to ATC, report to ATC 
our position, altitude and heading, say our intention.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>204.<audio src="audio5/204.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What should you do when you hear one aircraft making a distress transmission during 
flight?
We should stop transmitting and keep silent. But if the emergency a/c can’t contact ATC, 
we can help relay information.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>205.<audio src="audio5/205.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Could you tell me your company fuel policy?
 My company has several principles for fuel policy: safe, green, environment-friendly, 
low-carbon, economical. The company encourages us to save fuel. But in any cases, we 
must ensure the flight safety.
 The quantity of fuel should be decided according to the flight plan; captain has the right 
to change the fuel quantity if necessary.
 we have requirements for minimum fuel and emergency fuel.
 the airlines encourages us to save fuel, pilots can get 10% bonus for the fuel saved, but 
we must ensure flight safety.
 It’s necessary to save fuel in our flight training in order to ensure safety, especially in 
cross-country training. Because the fuel on board is limited, we should adjust the mixture 
of gas and air and keep an economical speed. (student pilots)
The pilots should establish proper descent profile, so as to avoid going around.
The pilots should keep safe separation with the preceding aircraft to avoid holding or 
going around.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>206.<audio src="audio5/206.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Do you think a high cruising altitude helps reduce fuel consumption?
 Usually yes. The air density at the high cruising altitude is low, so the drag is less, so the 
a/c consumes less fuel.
 Generally speaking, The optimum cruising altitude is between 10,000 and 11,000 meters. 
However, there are many factors affecting fuel consumption, like wind, temperature.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>207.<audio src="audio5/207.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What is your opinion about pilot’s role in saving fuel?
 I think pilots play an important role in saving fuel. Pilots can decide the optimum fuel 
quantity by selecting optimum speed, altitude and route. If conditions permit, pilots can 
make a visual and straight-in approach to save fuel. If possible, pilots can extend the 
flaps late to save fuel.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>208.<audio src="audio5/208.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What is your opinion on airlines’ policy of encouraging pilots to save fuel?
Generally speaking, it’s a good policy. Now the environment-friendly, low-carbon fuel 
policy has become a world trend. It is good for environment protection. It also helps the 
company reduce cost and make more profit. It can also increase pilots’ income.
But on the other hand, it may also cause problems. For example, sometimes ground 
operations may take a long time. So pilots may need more fuel. If we are short of fuel, 
we can’t go to the destination. So I think we can’t over-emphasize the fuel-saving policy. 
We should always put safety at the first place.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>209.<audio src="audio5/209.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What is the maximum fuel quantity that your aircraft can carry?
 Fuel quantity affects aircraft endurance. I fly B747-400, the maximum fuel quantity is 
164 tons.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>210.<audio src="audio5/210.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>How can pilots determine their flight endurance? 
 before the flight, the pilots determine their flight endurance according to the flight plan 
and weather conditions, distance to the destination, aircraft performance, and so 
on. During cruising, we can monitor fuel consumption indication to determine the 
endurance.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>211.<audio src="audio5/211.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What might cause fuel shortage on board?
 Fuel vent system problem, strong head wind, Fuel leak, Miscalculation of fuel quantity, 
Flying at a low level for a long time, long holding, go round the bad weather，missed 
approach

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>212.<audio src="audio5/212.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Under what circumstances do pilots need to declare fuel emergency? 
 There are regulations concerning reserved fuel. When the aircraft flies over the 
destination airport, but there’s fuel shortage and starts to consume the reserved fuel,
and the remaining fuel or the flight endurance is less than 30 minutes, it’s necessary to 
inform ATC and declare fuel emergency. 
 If there’s serious fuel leakage, we may consider declaring emergency. 
We can’t accept any delay or holding.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>213.<audio src="audio5/213.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Have you heard about any incident or accident due to fuel emergency? What’s the 
importance of fuel check?
 It’s important to carry out fuel check. If there’s fuel shortage or fuel leakage, we can 
find it out in time.
 Monitor the fuel quantity gauge to get the important parameters like fuel remaining, 
the consumed fuel and so on. (We monitor MFD. MFD displays fuel remaining, the 
consumed fuel. )
 Compare the figure calculated by FMC with that in the fuel gauge, to see if there’s any 
big difference. 
 Consumed fuel plus remaining fuel is total fuel quantity. 
 We are required to carry out fuel check every half an hour, we check the remaining fuel, 
fuel flow for each engine.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>214.<audio src="audio5/214.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>According to regulations, what does ‘minimum fuel” refer to?
Minimum fuel is not considered as fuel emergency. But at this point, we must inform ATC 
of our situation. If we are put into hold or long delay, we may start to burn our reserve 
fuel. So we may request priority handling. 
If the flight is further delayed, the aircraft will be in emergency fuel situation.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>215.<audio src="audio5/215.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>How would you report your fuel minimum situation to ATC?/ If you have “minimum fuel”
situation, what will you do?
 I may not declare fuel emergency, but I’ll inform ATC that we will start to burn the 
reserve fuel if we are delayed any further.
 I should inform ATC that I can’t accept any delay or holding or change of altitude before 
landing. And we need priority.
 I report to ATC of my remaining fuel and flight endurance.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>216.<audio src="audio5/216.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Do you know anything about TCAS? What does TCAS refer to? 
 Traffic Collision Avoidance System

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>217.<audio src="audio5/217.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What’s the use of TCAS? 
 It’s used to help avoid traffic collision.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>218.<audio src="audio5/218.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Is your aircraft equipped with TCAS? Could you please describe how your TCAS works?
 Yes. It helps pilots detect traffic nearby. TCAS consists of TA and RA. TA refers to Traffic Advisory. When another traffic is 1000ft above or below your aircraft, TA alerts you by giving the sound of “traffic, traffic”.(gives the pilots aural warning) RA refers to Resolution Advisory. When another traffic is 25 seconds away from your a/c. RA gives you the warning by saying “climb” or “descend”.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>219.<audio src="audio5/219.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Have you ever encountered any TCAS alert in flight? Can you describe it?
 TA is common during flight. (we sometimes receive TA alerts.)But I never encounter RA 
during flight.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>220.<audio src="audio5/220.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Have you ever heard about mid-air collision accident? Could you please say something 
about it?
 As far as I know, two aircraft collided over German airspace. There are two reasons 
leading to this crash. One a/c followed TCAS, while the a/c from Russia didn’t follow 
TCAS but followed the German controller's instructions. The controller gave the 
incorrect instructions, which resulted in mid-air collision.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>221.<audio src="audio5/221.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>In your opinion, what can we do to avoid mid-air collision?
Pilots should strictly follow controllers’ instructions, when unsure of clearance, pilots 
should confirm with ATC.
Big aircraft should be equipped with TCAS. Pilots should monitor TCAS to get 
information about other traffic flying in the same airspace and strictly follow TCAS alerts.
At the same time, pilots should monitor the frequency, listen to the traffic information 
to improve situational awareness. 
Controllers should monitor radar and get detailed information of every a/c in his 
controlled area. Whenever a/c disappears from radar, controllers should deal with the 
problem as soon as possible.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>222.<audio src="audio5/222.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Nowadays the terminal airspace is becoming more and more crowded, do you think there are any potential risks?
In this limited airspace, there are a lot of aircraft departing and approaching. As a 
result, there are more possibilities of near-misses and even mid-air collision. 
On final, if a landing a/c doesn't vacate the r/w in time, the a/c behind has to go around. 
An aircraft is on final encountering abnormal situations, if it goes around, it may be 
dangerously close to the departing a/c.
In international airports, English may become a barrier in radio communication.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>223.<audio src="audio5/223.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What can be done to avoid a/c conflicts at busy airports?
 Controllers can Increase traffic separation to reduce workload. 
 controllers should monitor the radar to get traffic information.
 if there’re two r/w, one r/w for departing, the other for arriving.
 use advanced facilities
 pilots should monitor frequency to avoid mishearing instructions. Pilots should follow 
controller’s instructions, when unsure, confirm with controllers. Pilots should be familiar 
with departing and arriving procedures, airport layout.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>224.<audio src="audio5/224.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What should pilots do to prevent near misses? 
 Pilots should get information about other traffic flying in the same airspace and 
strictly follow RA. Follow controllers’ instructions, (keep rate of descent less than 1000 
feet. ) 
 maintain safe separation with preceding aircraft

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>225.<audio src="audio5/225.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What is wake turbulence?
Each aircraft leaves wake turbulence behind during flying. Wake turbulence is the 
turbulence left by the aircraft ahead.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>226.<audio src="audio5/226.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Is wake turbulence dangerous to the flight? What do you think?
The aircraft may encounter wake turbulence at any altitude. But it’s the most dangerous 
during takeoff and landing where there is not enough altitude to recover. It may cause 
the loss of altitude and control.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>227.<audio src="audio5/227.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>When would you expect to encounter wake turbulence? How would you avoid it?
When you takeoff or land behind a medium or large heavy aircraft, you encounter wake 
turbulence. Pilots should keep safe separation with preceding aircraft. If a heavy aircraft 
is just taking or landing ahead, the pilot behind must wait at least 3 minutes. If a medium 
aircraft is ahead, the pilot behind must wait no less than 2 minutes.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>228.<audio src="audio5/228.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Suppose you are experiencing Engine-out over obstacles, what’s the SOP for this 
abnormal situation?
Each airport has single engine failure departure procedure. After airborne, follow 
runway heading, fly 2 miles, and then turn right or left.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>229.<audio src="audio5/229.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>If your a/c triggers a “Too low terrain, too low terrain” aural alerts, what’s the best way to make terrain avoidance?
Follow EGPWS recovery procedures, set max power, pitch up 20 degrees, maintain 
configuration.
Under daylight VMC, a terrain caution occurs, what should you do next?
In case of daylight, we’ll visually observe to confirm if there is any obstacle. If there is 
terrain, we’ll make maneuver or climb higher altitude to avoid it.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>230.<audio src="audio5/230.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What are your company’s cockpit entry rules?
When the pilot wants to leave the cockpit, he must make a phone call to the purser to 
make sure there is no passenger around the cockpit door. And when leaving the 
cockpit, the pilot has to shut the door. When returning to the cockpit, the pilot has to 
make sure there’s no passenger around.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>231.<audio src="audio5/231.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Who may be allowed to enter the cockpit?
The flight crew and the designated cabin crew.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>232.<audio src="audio5/232.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> In flight what are procedures for crew members to enter the cockpit?
Usually before the flight, the captain will give a briefing to the cabin crew, including 
the procedures in normal and abnormal situations, like hijack. For example, in case of 
hijack, the cabin crew knock the door three times.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>233.<audio src="audio5/233.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Can you drink alcohol before the flight? What is the regulation like on drinking 
alcohol?
Pilots are not allowed to drink alcohol 12 hours before the flight.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>234.<audio src="audio5/234.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What does RVR stand for?
Runway Visual Range

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>235.<audio src="audio5/235.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>How can pilots obtain RVR before departure?
Pilots can get RVR from ATIS, ATC or dispatch.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>236.<audio src="audio5/236.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Does your company operate low visibility take-off (LVTO)?
We need qualifications to operate LVTO. Qualifications refer to equipment, 
personnel and airport.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>237.<audio src="audio5/237.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>When will low visibility procedure be required?
When RVR is below 400 meters, or when there are no runway centerline lights, RVR is 
below 500 meters.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>238.<audio src="audio5/238.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>How many portable fire extinguishers are there on your aircraft?
It depends on what type of aircraft we fly. There are 6 fire extinguishers on B737.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>239.<audio src="audio5/239.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>When should we discharge these fire extinguishers in flight?
In case of smoke or fire, we may discharge them.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>240.<audio src="audio5/240.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What are the consequences if the flight crew discharges the fire extinguisher by 
mistake?
We may have to divert, since there is a regulation about the number of fire 
extinguishers on the aircraft, if we use any of them, we can’t continue the flight.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>241.<audio src="audio5/241.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What’s the procedure to discharge the fire extinguisher for the engine?
First, crew members should communicate with each other to confirm which engine is 
on fire, then put throttle to idle, shut down the engine, cut off the fuel supply.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>242.<audio src="audio5/242.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Have you ever flown red eye flight? If no, what kinds of flights are red eye flights?
From 12 o’clock midnight until 6 o’clock in the morning.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>243.<audio src="audio5/243.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>When preparing for this flight, what can a pilot do reduce the stress? / What can you 
do to recover after a red eye flight?
We should relax and have more sleep before and after red eye flights.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>244.<audio src="audio5/244.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>How would you comment a red eye flight？
I think red eye flight have potential risks, because they make pilots very tired and the 
visibility is not good. Pilots work under great stress/pressure.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>245.<audio src="audio5/245.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Why do you think red eye flight is a trend in civil aviation?
Red eye flights may become a trend, because the airlines can increase the number of 
flights and get more profit from that. (increase aircraft utilization and reduce cost)

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>246.<audio src="audio5/246.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>If ATC request you to hold at a significant fix, and what should you do?
We need to confirm with ATC, ask ATC the reasons for holding, how long is the 
holding. If we are required to hold more than 20 minutes, we need to check fuel 
endurance.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>247.<audio src="audio5/247.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>When you request specific holding instructions from controller, what information do you need?
We need to get a lot of information, like altitude, speed, heading, inbound track, 
outbound time, right hand or left hand orbit.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>248.<audio src="audio5/248.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What should you do if you have different opinion with other crew members?/ if there is any disagreement in the cockpit, how do you deal with it?
 
 During the flight I think the most important thing is to ensure flight safety, so 
teamwork is very important. Good teamwork can help the crew make right decisions and 
reduce errors. In the cockpit I will focus on my own responsibility, and at the same time 
cooperate with other crew members. When we have different ideas on certain 
procedures, we will follow SOP.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>249.<audio src="audio5/249.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What do you think of CRM in a cockpit?
What do you understand about CRM?
Do you think CRM is important?
I think CRM is very important. CRM stands for crew resource management. It includes 
communication and teamwork among crew members, all the onboard and ground 
resources, such as instruments and tower services, as well as standard operation 
procedures. CRM is very important, because good CRM can help make right decision 
and reduce crew errors, improve efficiency and solve the problems more effectively.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>250.<audio src="audio5/250.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Do you think human factors are important to flight safety? Why?
 according to data, 80% aviation accidents are caused by human factors. The pilots play an 
important role during flight.
 For example, if the pilot misheard the instructions from the controller, it may cause 
mid-air collision.
 In case of system failure, if the pilot makes incorrect judgment, it may cause the pilot to 
take wrong actions, which will make situation even worse. 
 If there’s bad weather ahead of the aircraft, but the pilot makes no response, the 
aircraft will be damaged by the bad weather.
For example, driver’s mistakes cause the collision between the truck and the aircraft.
Because the modern aircraft become more and more automated and reliable, pilots rely on 
their computers. But when there’s loss of instrument or system failure, pilots should 
always be the last defense to save the airplane.
