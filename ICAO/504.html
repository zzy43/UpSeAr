							<tr><td>151.<audio src="audio5/151.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>  How often do you have your recurrent training? How many hours are you required to 
complete each time?
 Once every half a year. 12 hours.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>152.<audio src="audio5/152.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What training subjects do you review in your recurrent training?
 Normal and abnormal situations. Such as engine failure,…….

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>153.<audio src="audio5/153.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>In your opinion which subject is the most difficult for you to deal with? Why?
one engine failure. Because it’s hard to control the a/c if one engine fails. it requires crew to 
have a good ability/ good flying skills/and teamwork. /to be familiar with SOP.
It’s hard to control the aircraft when making maneuvers, like stall recovery, spin, steep turn, 
fly at low speed

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>154.<audio src="audio5/154.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Do you think it’s necessary for pilots to have recurrent training?
Yes. Recurrent can help pilots get familiar with procedures and improve flying skills. In case 
of abnormal situations, pilots can make quick response and make the right decision.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>155.<audio src="audio5/155.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Why is simulator training important?
 Pilots can get more experience in simulator training. During training pilots may have the 
opportunities to practice many emergency procedures, which can improve pilots’ ability 
to handle unusual situations. 
 Pilots seldom encounter these abnormal situations in real flight, so it’s necessary to 
practice emergency procedures. In case of emergency pilots can make a quick 
response/reaction and make right judgement.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>156.<audio src="audio5/156.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>When and where did you first learn to fly?
 Describe your first solo-flight.
My first solo flight was in CAFUC. At that time I was a student pilot of CAFUC / Air Force 
Flying school. Our training aircraft was x x . I was very nervous when I entered the 
cockpit. My hands were trembling when holding the control column. And I was so 
excited that I almost forgot everything I learned. When I became relaxed, it seemed 
much easier to control the plane. I followed the instructions and successfully made my 
first solo.
After I passed solo flight test, I could/ was allowed to perform the first solo flight. (My 
instructor helped me check the equipment, ) I was nervous before the flight. After I was 
airborne/ took off, I could not believe I was flying the a/c by myself. After landing/ I 
finished the flight successfully I felt very excited.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>008.<audio src="audio5/008.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What have you learned from your flight instructor in your flight school?/ What valuable 
experience have you learned from your flight school?
I learned a lot from him, such as flying skills, SOP, checklists, aviation knowledge and so on. I 
learned how to keep calm under abnormal situations.
During the training in my flight school, I have learned a lot – not only essential flying 
knowledge and skills, but also ability to deal with dangerous situations. In addition, I 
learned to understand the importance of flight safety. (strictly following all the rules 
and regulations in flight operations.) All of what I learned in the flight school is of great 
help in my flying career.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>158.<audio src="audio5/158.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Is the hydraulic system important to flight operations?
 Yes. Many a/c systems receive power from hydraulic system. Without hydraulic 
systems, the a/c may be out of control. It’s the essential system to operate a/c control 
surfaces, thrust reverser, brakes, yaw damper, autopilot and so on.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>159.<audio src="audio5/159.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> How many hydraulic systems are there on your aircraft? What are the functions of the 
hydraulic system?
 Most a/c have three. System A, B and alternate. It provides power to control/operate 
flight control surfaces, such as flaps, rudder, elevator, aileron; it also provides power to 
change configuration, such as landing gear, steering, brake, thrust reverser.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>160.<audio src="audio5/160.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>When one hydraulic system fails, will it affect the flight safety? 
Normally there are 2 or 3 hydraulic systems. If one system fails, the other two system are 
still operational. For example, both system A and B control the movement of rudder. In 
case of one system failure, the other system can still work. As a result, following QRH, 
we can continue our flight to destination. 
 If we have difficulty in controlling the a/c, we may request descent to lower level or 
request diversion.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>161.<audio src="audio5/161.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What are the consequences of the hydraulic system failure in flight?
If all the hydraulic systems have malfunctioned, it may cause serious problems. The 
landing gear may not be extended, the a/c has to make belly landing which is extremely 
dangerous.
If the flaps, spoilers, speedbrakes don’t work, the a/c needs longer landing distance 
because of higher landing speed, the a/c may overrun the r/w.
I fly Diamond 40, we only have one hydraulic system, it controls brakes. If it fails, it’s 
hard to stop the aircraft on the runway. The aircraft may skid off the runway, and aircraft 
structure may be damaged.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>162.<audio src="audio5/162.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>When there’s a hydraulic fluid leak, what will you do?
If the problem occurs on the ground, the pilot should get the mechanics to deal with 
that. If it happens during flight, the pilot should find out the reason for the malfunction 
and follow QRH/checklist to handle it, make right judgment and decision, then report to 
ATC and divert to the alternate.
Find out the problem, for example, check the hydraulic fluid quantity and pressure ; carry 
out hydraulic fluid low pressure checklist, report the situation to ATC, and request 
ground assistance when necessary.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>163.<audio src="audio5/163.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>If your landing gear can’t be extended on approach, what will you do?
I will perform the checklist. I try to re-extend it manually or use gravity to extend the 
gear. 
 Abort approach, join the holding pattern. Follow checklist. Manually extend the gear, 
make maneuvers. If unsure the gear is completely down, request a low pass for visual 
check.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>164.<audio src="audio5/164.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>If you decide to make a belly landing, what preparations should you make before 
landing?
check the fuel; request to join a holding pattern to burn or dump the fuel; declare 
emergency; request emergency assistance on arrival; request foam carpet, fire truck, 
ambulances…after landing; inform the cabin crew of the situation; The flight attendants 
inform the passengers of the forced landing and prepare for the emergency evacuation.
If you decide to make a belly landing, request fire truck and ambulance upon landing, request a foamed r/w at the touch down zone. After landing, execute emergency 
evacuation as soon as possible.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>165.<audio src="audio5/165.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Do you think belly landing is safe? Why?
 No. Belly landings carry the risk of causing accidents. For example, if the aircraft lands 
too fast or too hard, the aircraft may be broken or catch fire; passengers may get injured. 
But if the pilot has good flying skills and land very carefully, it can be a successful landing.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>166.<audio src="audio5/166.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What kinds of flight control surfaces does an aircraft have?
Elevator, rudder, aileron, spoiler, flaps, slats, speed brakes, stabilizer

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>167.<audio src="audio5/167.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Please describe the positions of these control surfaces.
Rudder is at the trailing edge of vertical stabilizer.
Elevator is at the trailing edge of horizontal stabilizer.
Aileron is at the rear of outboard wings.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>168.<audio src="audio5/168.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Can you explain the different functions of these control surfaces?
Rudder is used to change yaw. Elevator is used to change pitch. Ailerons are used to 
change/roll bank angle. Flaps are used to increase drag and lift, reduce speed.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>169.<audio src="audio5/169.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What type of aircraft are you flying now? Have you flown any other types of aircraft? / 
can you describe your flying experience?
 I’m flying B747. I have flown xxx, a single propeller aircraft. I had my initial training in 
1997. I had transition training in 1999 and began to fly B737.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>170.<audio src="audio5/170.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What kind of aircraft do you prefer flying? If you are given a choice to fly A320 or B737, 
which one would you choose? / If you could choose any type of aircraft to fly, which type 
will you choose?
 I like to fly big aircraft, because they have better performance and are more 
comfortable. 
 I prefer A320. It’s easy to control. It has advanced flight management system which 
greatly reduces pilots’ workload.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>171.<audio src="audio5/171.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What type of aircraft are you flying now? Do you like it? What are the technological 
advantages and disadvantages of the aircraft you fly now? 
EMB190. it’s not advanced, there isn’t large space in the cockpit. Its endurance is not 
long enough. But it’ not expensive, suitable for regional flights or short-haul flights.
A320. It uses a lot of advanced technology, such as fly-by-wire, glass cockpit, etc. it has a 
comfortable cockpit. It’s highly automated and computerized. But it isn’t designed for 
student pilots. 
Flying airbus a/c is just like sitting in the office, all you have to do is to monitor and 
operate the computer. But the problem is that pilots may rely too much on the 
computer. Once they encounter electrical system failure or computer malfunction, pilots 
may lose control of the a/c.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>172.<audio src="audio5/172.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>what do you prefer to fly, domestic routes or international routes?
 I prefer to fly international routes. Because I can get good pay, on the other hand, I can 
visit different countries.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>173.<audio src="audio5/173.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What do you prefer to fly, long haul routes or short haul routes?
 I prefer short haul routes. I can have more opportunities to practice takeoffs and 
landings.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>174.<audio src="audio5/174.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Have you ever encountered an electrical system failure during flight?
Yes. Last month I flew from… to… I encountered electrical system failure at cruising 
level. I Followed SOP and reported to ATC, finally Made a diversion.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>175.<audio src="audio5/175.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What will you do if one of your electrical systems fails?
We have three sets of electrical systems. If one system fails, first we start APU, then we 
connect it to the malfunctioned generator. Then we can continue our flight to the 
destination.
For our aircraft, the battery is the only source for electrical power, so we don’t have 
display for PFD and ND, we’ll use traditional instruments.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>176.<audio src="audio5/176.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>If air conditioning system fails during flight, what will you do?
 We have two sets of system. If one set fails we can continue our flight. We select 
suitable level. If two sets both fail, we request lower level because it may affect the 
pressurization of the a/c. 
 If one of the packs has malfunctioned, the aircraft can continue the flight at the 
altitude below 7500 meters.
 If both packs have malfunctioned, it may be difficult to control the cabin altitude, we’ll 
request descent to lower than 3000 meters.
 Start APU, use bleed air to pressurize the aircraft, then continue the flight to the 
destination.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>177.<audio src="audio5/177.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>How do you fix the air-conditioning problem in flight?
 We will reset the air-conditioning system according to the checklist/ we will do the 
checklist. If the problem is fixed, we will continue our flight. If not, we will make an 
emergency descent or divert to the suitable airport.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>178.<audio src="audio5/178.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Could you say something about the oxygen system on your aircraft?
 There are three kinds of oxygen systems. One kind is for the crew, stowed in the cockpit; 
second kind is for passengers, stowed over the passengers’ seats; third kind is portable 
oxygen bottles, for emergency use.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>179.<audio src="audio5/179.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> In which circumstances do we use oxygen masks in flight?
 In case of depressurization, the aircraft needs emergency descent, we need to use 
oxygen masks. If the cabin altitude is over 4000m, we also need oxygen masks. if the 
aircraft departs at the airports elevation above 4000m, the crew has to put on oxygen 
masks.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>180.<audio src="audio5/180.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What does EFIS stand for?
Electronic flight instrument system.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>181.<audio src="audio5/181.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Is your aircraft equipped with EFIS display? If yes, can you introduce EFIS to me? If no, 
what kind of flight instruments do you use in your cockpit to display the flight 
information?
Yes. EFIS consists of PFD and ND(B737); PFD and MFD(Diamond-40).
PFD displays airspeed, altitude, attitude, heading, vertical speed; MFD displays flight path, 
waypoints, engine parameters.
It displays a lot of information important to flight, including airspeed, altitude, attitude, 
heading, vertical speed, flight path, wind conditions, waypoints. It integrates all 
information into one display, which may reduce pilot’s workload. 
instrument comparison

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>182.<audio src="audio5/182.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What are the advantages and disadvantages of analogue instruments? 
It’s better for the student pilots to use the analogue instruments. It can help pilots 
improve their flying skills. They are more reliable. On the other hand, it may increase 
pilots’ workload. Traditional instruments are not accurate.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>183.<audio src="audio5/183.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Compare the digital displays in the modern cockpit with the traditional analogue 
instruments, which do you prefer?
Modern aircraft combine both the digital and analogue instruments in the cockpit. 
Digital displays may help reduce the workload for pilots. They are more accurate. But 
they have disadvantages too, such as high cost, difficulty in maintenance.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>184.<audio src="audio5/184.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What are the advantages and disadvantages of side stick or control column?
Side stick is flight-by-wire. It is easier to control the aircraft; While Boeing Aircraft has 
control column. However, different people have different opinion about which is better. 
I prefer side stick because I am flying Airbus aircraft.
Most pilots think flying side stick is more like playing computer games. Using control 
column may give the pilots a feeling of control.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>185.<audio src="audio5/185.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What kind of emergency equipment do you have in the cockpit?
 Extinguisher, portable extinguisher, smoke goggles, oxygen masks, life vest, escape 
ropes, torch/flashlight, PBE (protective breathing equipment) and so on. 
 ELT(Emergency Location Transmitter)

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>186.<audio src="audio5/186.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Why are pilots required to be familiar with emergency equipment?
 pilots should be familiar with the layout and the functions of the emergency equipment. 
In case of emergency pilots can make a quick response and correct decision. pilots can 
save more people’s lives and help reduce damages to the aircraft.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>187.<audio src="audio5/187.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Under what circumstances would you use the oxygen mask?
In case of in-flight depressurization, and the cabin altitude is over 4000m, the pilots must put 
on oxygen masks.
 we would use oxygen masks in many abnormal situations, like smoke or fire in the 
cockpit, emergency descent, depressurization.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>188.<audio src="audio5/188.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What are the differences between urgency and distress situation?
In case of in-flight emergency when would you call MAYDAY? When would you call 
PANPAN? What’s the difference?
 distress situation is more critical than urgency situation. In case of distress, pilots call 
34
MAYDAY, while in urgency, pilots need to make PANPAN call.
 For example, if the aircraft encounters distress situations, such as engine problems, 
structural damage, depressurization, hijack, pilots have to declare the situation to ATC 
and call MAYDAY.
 If the aircraft encounters urgency situations, such as fuel shortage, system failure, 
passenger problems and so on, they have to declare the situation to ATC and call 
PANPAN.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>189.<audio src="audio5/189.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>When is it necessary for you to make an in-flight emergency descent?
If the crew suspect the aircraft suffers structural failure or rapid depressurization, the 
crew have to make an in-flight emergency descent.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>190.<audio src="audio5/190.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Have you ever encountered any urgency or distress situation? If yes, can you say 
something in detail? If not, can you give me an example?

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>191.<audio src="audio5/191.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What could you do in case of an emergency? Give me an example.
For example, in case of in-flight depressurization, we should keep control of the aircraft. 
I should follow SOP. Pilots, flight attendants and passengers must put on oxygen masks. 
We carry out an emergency descent, then I contact ATC, inform them of my situation and 
intention.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>192.<audio src="audio5/192.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What kind of supports do you need from ATC or ground personnel in case of emergency?
In case of emergency, I would report my situation to ATC, tell ATC my current position, 
intention, conditions of passengers and crew members. I may request ground assistance, 
depending on what emergency situations I encounter. 
If there’s seriously ill passenger, I request emergency services, like ambulance upon 
arrival.
If there’s cabin fire onboard the aircraft, I decide to carry out emergency evacuation, I’ll 
request fire services, medical services upon arrival.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>193.<audio src="audio5/193.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Who would be the last one to leave the aircraft in the event of emergency evacuation? 
Why do you think so?
I think the captain should be the last one to leave the aircraft. Captain is the leader in the 
cockpit, should be responsible for the safety of every person on board and aircraft and 
cargo . In case of emergency evacuation, captain should make sure all the crew and 
passengers have already safely evacuate the aircraft before he leaves. The CAAC’s 
regulation clearly states(specifies) that captain should be the last one to leave the 
aircraft in the event of emergency evacuation.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>194.<audio src="audio5/194.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>During flight operation, which crew member is responsible for radiotelephony 
communication with ATC?
 According to SOP, during ground operation, the FO communicates with ATC. In flight, if 
the FO controls the aircraft, the captain is PM, he is responsible for communicating with 
ATC.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>195.<audio src="audio5/195.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>When do you need to carry out radio check? How do you carry out the radio check? 
Could you please give me a detailed explanation?
 In initial contact, we carry out radio check by asking “how do you read me?” ATC 
answers: I can read you 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1. 
 During cruising, if there’s silence in radio for a long time, you need to check frequency 
and then call ATC. 
 Ask ATC: how do you read me? ATC answers: I can read you 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1. 5 means I can 
read you loud and clear, 4 means clear, 3means can hear but with difficulty, 2means 
intermittent/ cut in and out, 1 means I can’t read you. If ATC can only read me 3 or less, 
I’ll check the radio equipment, and request radio check again. 
Usually in flight, we don’t do the radio check again. Since the controller have more 
advanced equipment to show the quality of the signal, it’s not necessary to do the radio 
check again. If the controllers can’t read us clearly, they’ll ask me to do the radio check.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>196.<audio src="audio5/196.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>In your opinion what could pilots do to improve the quality of Radiotelephony 
communication?
Are there any efficient ways for the pilot and the controller to avoid misunderstanding 
with each other?
 First, check if the communication equipment is in good condition. /Make sure the 
equipment is working properly/ in good order
 During transmission use simple words and standard RT phraseology, and speak clearly, 
not too fast. When receiving message from ATC, do readback. If the information or 
instruction is not clear, ask the controller to repeat. Whenever there is a problem, 
contact ATC and state the nature of your problem and your intention.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>197.<audio src="audio5/197.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What are some communication requirements during an emergency?
 The pilots will transmit PANPAN or MAYDAY message to ATC. When encountering an 
urgency situation which requires timely but not immediate assistance, I will transmit a 
PANPAN message. When encountering a distress situation, such as fire, mechanical 
failure, structural damage, I will transmit a MAYDAY call.
 The pilots should tell the controllers their problems and intentions clearly. The controllers 
36
should inform the other aircraft in the vicinity of the emergency aircraft to help the crew 
complete emergency procedures.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>198.<audio src="audio5/198.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What kinds of communication equipment do you have on your aircraft?/ What are some 
of the ways you use to communicate with ATC?
VHF, HF, satellite telephone, ACARS 航空器通讯寻址报告系统, transponder.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>199.<audio src="audio5/199.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What are some of the ways you use to communicate with ATC? When do you use them?
HF and VHF. When we fly domestic flights, we are not far from the area control, we use VHF. 
When we fly international flights, we have to use HF since we are over the ocean or far 
from the control.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>200.<audio src="audio5/200.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What are your company’s procedures to deal with radio failure in flight?
 First, we should squawk 7600, make a blind transmission, then notify the company FOC 
(flight operation center) by ACARS, try to fly to destination as planned/ according to the 
flight plan. 
 Ask dispatch to inform the destination airport. They will help us make a safe landing.
 When we fly over the destination airport, we should make a visual circumdescent.
