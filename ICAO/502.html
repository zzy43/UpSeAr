							<tr><td>051.<audio src="audio5/051.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If the aircraft engine ingests foreign object, will it endanger flight safety? Why? / Is it 
dangerous if the aircraft engine ingests foreign object?
 Yes, of course. A foreign object may cause engine flame out. The power may be 
reduced. The engine performance may be reduced.
 If the engine sucks a foreign object, it may cause engine surge, vibration or even 
engine fire or failure. During takeoff, the power is at its maximum, if the engines catch 
fire at this critical time, it will be in distress situation.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>052.<audio src="audio5/052.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>  During which phases of flight is engine ingestion most likely to occur? Why?
 Engine ingestion is most likely to occur during takeoff and before V1 when the aircraft is 
close to the ground. During taxi, some debris on the runway may be ingested by the 
engines. Bird ingestion sometimes occur at initial climb stage.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>053.<audio src="audio5/053.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If your aircraft engine ingests some foreign object during takeoff rolling, what would you 
do?
 If we encounter this situation before V1, we must abort right away. If it happens after V1, 
we will continue takeoff. Once airborne, retract flaps and carry out after-takeoff 
checklist, analyze the situation. If the engine doesn’t work properly, request returning.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>054.<audio src="audio5/054.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If bird ingestion happens to you during your initial climb, how will you deal with the situation?
 If it causes serious situations, such as engine flameout or structural damage, we must 
report to ATC and request returning. If it’s not serious, we’ll check the a/c and system 
and continue our flight.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>055.<audio src="audio5/055.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What can be done to prevent FOD from happening?
What can we or airport authority do beforehand to avoid such situation from happening?
 Pilot should inform ATC if they find out any debris on the ground. Delay takeoff or 
approach if there are bird activities in the vicinity of the airport. The airport authorities 
must keep the taxiways and runways clean, use the dispersing vans to frighten birds 
away.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>056.<audio src="audio5/056.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Under what circumstances may the aircraft suffer structural damage? Can you name a few?
Many things can cause structural damage, such as hard landing, bird strikes, lightning 
strikes, extreme turbulence, explosion and so on.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>057.<audio src="audio5/057.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Do you have any experience of aircraft structural damage? 
 Yes. I have ever encountered bird strike. Bird strike made the windshield broken.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>058.<audio src="audio5/058.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Can you tell me when it is necessary to execute emergency evacuation? / In which 
situation do we need to evacuate? / Under what circumstance does the pilot need to 
make emergency evacuation?
 we need to evacuate under these situations, such as force landing, ditching, engine fire, 
bomb on board, smoke or fire in the aircraft and so on. 
 (There could be many reasons, such as fire, smoke, explosion, runway excursion 
(running out of the runway), landing gear problem and so on.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>059.<audio src="audio5/059.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If you decide to carry out emergency evacuation after landing, what preparations should 
you make beforehand?/ How do you prepare the evacuation?/ what should the flight 
crew do when they decide to execute emergency evacuation?
 If we decide to perform emergency evacuation after landing, we should follow SOP. 
The procedures include: report to ATC about our decision for evacuation, inform the 
cabin crew, inform passenger of evacuation direction，request ground assistance, review 
the checklist. The captain makes the announcement on how to evacuate after landing.
 The crew also needs to consider landing position, which is on the ground or ditching.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>060.<audio src="audio5/060.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Do you think a good briefing with the cabin crew may improve the chances of a 
successful evacuation? Why?
 Yes. I think so. In the briefing, the captain will assign tasks and give important 
information to cabin crew. For example, the captain should inform the cabin crew of 
evacuation direction. If the fire is from the right side of the cabin, the cabin crew will 
guide the passengers to leave the aircraft from left side, which will increase the chances 
of survival.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>061.<audio src="audio5/061.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> How many evacuation slides are there on your aircraft?
 I fly B737. There are 4 slides on my aircraft.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>062.<audio src="audio5/062.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What are the locations of these slides?
 There are 2 slides on each side of the aircraft. Under each cabin door, there is an 
evacuation slide.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>063.<audio src="audio5/063.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What can evacuation slides be used for?
 After the forced landing, the emergency slides may be deployed to help passengers and 
crew member to evacuate quickly.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>064.<audio src="audio5/064.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If there’s a drunk passenger in flight, what will you do?
 Inform the security staff and keep an eye on him/ watch him, keep other pax away 
from him, prevent him from damaging the plane. (See sick passengers) air marshal
 I’ll ask the air marshal to restrain the passenger.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>065.<audio src="audio5/065.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If there’s a fight going on between passengers during flight, what would you do? 
(quarrel) 
 Inform the security staff, stop them, separate them, watch them. If they are seriously 
injured, (see sick pax)

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>066.<audio src="audio5/066.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What would you do if a passenger refused to check in oversized baggage at the gate?
 it’s not my duty. I contact dispatch and ask the dispatch to inform the ground staff to 
deal with it.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>067.<audio src="audio5/067.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What kind of medical help can the cabin crew provide to the pax on board?
In abnormal situation, we provide emergency service, such as first aid, medical service; 
comfort them by giving them better service (more food, drinks) and further information.
 for example, if a pax has heart attack, the flight attendant can take out the medicine 
and put it into the pax’s mouth.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>068.<audio src="audio5/068.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If one of pax suffered a heart attack during flight, what would you do?
 I will look for a doctor on board; ask cabin crew to give first aid; report to ATC, if 
necessary, request diversion to nearest airport and medical service upon landing.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>069.<audio src="audio5/069.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If your captain or FO becomes incapacitated ([,inkə‘pæsi,teitid]失能的) / lose 
consciouness what will you do?
 I’ll take control of the aircraft. I’ll make a PA to see if there’s anyone on board can give 
me a hand or ask the flight attendants help me carry out checklist. Then I declare medical 
emergency, request landing at the nearest suitable airport and medical services upon 
arrival.
I take over the control of the plane. Ask the flight attendant to help move the captain 
away from his seat. Notify ATC of our situation and intention. ask the flight attendants 
help me carry out checklist.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>070.<audio src="audio5/070.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Under what circumstances would you declare medical emergency?
 Crew members become incapacitated, passengers suffer heart attack or are seriously 
injured, some infectious diseases on board like bird flu.
 if a pregnant woman is about to give birth to a baby, I need to call PANPAN.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>071.<audio src="audio5/071.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If you make a hard landing, how would you explain to your boss?
 I should report to the relevant department, to check the aircraft. Then I file a report, 
including some data (fill in TLB and QAR=quick access recorder) and tell them what 
happened. If it is a serious problem, the safety inspection department will make an 
investigation. We should learn the lesson from that situation and improve the flying 
skills.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>072.<audio src="audio5/072.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If you are approaching “duty time limit” and still in flight, would that affect your decision 
making? 
 No. normally we don’t have these situations, if it happens, it won’t affect our decision, 
because we think safety is the most important. We’ll continue the flight, make a normal 
landing, and then inform the dispatch of this situation. Cancel the next flight.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>073.<audio src="audio5/073.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What are the procedures for engine fire during flight?
 First, the crew must confirm which engine is on fire. Then they perform the engine fire 
checklist step by step from memory, (such as reduce the thrust lever to idle position, and 
shut down the affected engine and pull the fire handle..., discharge the fire extingushier) 
The other crew member declares the emergency situation to ATC and call mayday, and 
request a safe altitude.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>074.<audio src="audio5/074.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What should you do if you decide to return for landing due to engine failure?
 report to ATC, carry out checklist, check altitude and fuel, if I can’t make landing at my 
airport, I’ll choose an airfield or grass strip to make force landing. 
 check the weight of my aircraft, if it’s over maximum landing weight, I’ll burn the fuel 
first before landing.
 inform the cabin crew and pax of our current situation, ask them to prepare for 
emergency evacuation.
 request emergency service, like ambulance, fire truck upon landing.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>075.<audio src="audio5/075.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If pilots make a decision to reject takeoff due to engine fire, what should they be careful 
about?
They should really be careful about the speed at that moment and the remaining runway 
length. 
If the airspeed is under 100 knots, then pilots should really focus on the direction control. 
Then follow the SOPs to carry out the engine fire checklist. If the fire is not extinguished, 
then the captain should make the emergency evacuation.
If the airspeed is more than 100 knots, then pilot should pay attention to both runway 
length and direction control. They should do the best to stop the aircraft within the 
runway.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>076.<audio src="audio5/076.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If pilots make a decision to continue takeoff due to engine fire, what should they do 
next?
Control the airplane and follow the SOPs.
1
st, we will keep control of the airplane, which is the most important thing. 2nd, there are 
several checklists then we make a landing as soon as possible. In this case, we usually 
choose the departure airport. Request to return for landing to the original runway. 3rd
, 
after finish the procedure, we should request fire truck and medical service upon landing 
and expect emergency evacuation after landing.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>077.<audio src="audio5/077.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> During cruise if you observe smoke in your flight deck, what will you do? 
 Put on the smoke goggles and oxygen masks, establish inner communication, do the 
appropriate checklist, follow smoke removal procedures, declare an emergency, request 
emergency services and immediate landing, consider evacuation after landing.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>078.<audio src="audio5/078.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What may be some possible reasons for smoke in the flight deck?
 there’re many reasons for smoke, such as lightning strike, passengers smoking in the 
lavatory, overheat of the electrical system, flammable items in the cargo.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>079.<audio src="audio5/079.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> During cruise if you observe smoke in the cabin, what will you do? /if the flight attendant 
reports that there’s smoke in the cabin, what will you do?
 Keep the cockpit door closed, find out where the smoke is from, put on the smoke 
goggles and oxygen masks , do the smoke checklist, request emergency descent, switch 
off the air-conditioning system, switch off the power in the galley, consider evacuation 
after landing. Ask the cabin crew to follow smoke removal procedure.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>080.<audio src="audio5/080.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What navigational aids do you use?
 VOR, DME, ILS, GPS

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>081.<audio src="audio5/081.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If you encounter navigation failure, how can ATC help you?
 if part of navigation equipment fail, we can use other equipment to navigate. If we have 
all navigation failure, keep our present heading, we request radar vector.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>082.<audio src="audio5/082.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If you get lost during flight, what will you do?
 under visual flights, we climb higher level to confirm our position, resume normal 
navigation. (look for a landmark and then confirm our position) Under instrument flights, 
we will hold in the present position, report to ATC, request radar vector. 
 maintain present position and altitude, report to ATC, and request radar vector.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>083.<audio src="audio5/083.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What are advantages of ILS approach compared with VOR approach?
 ILS approach provides both the localizer and glide slope( both the horizontal and 
vertical guidance), it’s a precision approach. VOR approach only provides course, it’s 
non-precision approach.
 ILS approach is more accurate, more advanced, safer and easier than VOR approach. 
 the pilots can receive the signal of the localizer and glide slope. There’s an indication 
on the computer, so it’s easier for the pilots to control the rate of descent and maintain 
the heading. The decision height and visibility for ILS approach is lower than that of VOR 
approach. ILS approach requires lower weather conditions, so it can help increase traffic 
volume and reduce delays.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>084.<audio src="audio5/084.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What are the possible reason for the a/c to be out of control?/ what may cause the a/c to 
be out of control?
 Control system failure, all hydraulic system failure, severe icing, severe turbulence, bird 
strike, jammed control surfaces.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>085.<audio src="audio5/085.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What are the basic flight control limitations of your a/c?
 I fly DA 40. Maximum Takeoff weight is 1150 kilograms. 
 I fly Cessna 172. Maximum Takeoff weight is 2550 pounds. 
 bank angle is no more than 45 degrees
 maximum speed restriction for DA 40 is 118knots . 
Minimum control speed is 49 kts. 
 maximum cruising speed is 129 knots.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>086.<audio src="audio5/086.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If you lose flight control, what would you do? / If your flight control is jammed, what will you do? (eg. Elevator, aileron, rudder, flap)
if the elevator is jammed, we should maintain the attitude, reduce power and use 
elevator trim tab.
If the aileron is jammed, we can use the rudder to control rolling. 
if the rudder is jammed, use the aileron to make turning.
if the flight control is jammed, it’s a dangerous situation. We’ll follow SOP, perform the 
checklist. For example, the flap is jammed, we’ll adjust the flap handle. If we can’t fix the 
problem, we’ll report to ATC, request no flaps/flapless landing, request longest r/w and 
emergency equipment.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>087.<audio src="audio5/087.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> In heavy fog, if you miss correct taxiway, what will you do?
 Stop the aircraft, turn on all the lights, report to ATC, notify ATC of the marking, request 
a follow-me car.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>088.<audio src="audio5/088.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> During taxiing, how can you avoid the risks of collision in heavy fog? 
 Be familiar with the taxi routes. When unsure of the position, confirm with ATC. Stop the 
aircraft immediately when miss the correct taxiway. Turn on anti-collision lights. Study 
airport map carefully. Taxi slowly, request follow-me car. (Turn up the lighting system at 
the airport. ) Ask ATC to inform the crew every time before turning. Monitor the 
frequency, listen to other pilots’ reports, improve situational awareness.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>089.<audio src="audio5/089.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Does your company have any training to familiarize you with new airports?
 In our company, we have this kind of training. For example, we take lessons to get 
familiar with the new airport. Another way is our instructors fly to the airport first and 
then bring back some materials, which helps the other pilots get to know the new 
airport.
If it’s a complicated airport, we have practice on the simulator. 
In our cross-country flight training, if it’s the first time I fly to the airport. Before the 
flight, my instructor will help me get familiar with new airport. We get to know a lot of 
information about the airport, including approach type, airport facilities, taxi routes, runway 
length, and so on.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>090.<audio src="audio5/090.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> After landing at an unfamiliar airport, if you miss the first rapid exit, what will you do?
 if we miss it, we’ll report to ATC, request vacating the runway at the next exit.
 if there isn’t rapid exit or the next rapid exit is far, we request backtrack.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>091.<audio src="audio5/091.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Have you ever encountered equipment malfunction during flight?
 Transponder, weather radar, autopilot, auto throttle, TCAS, PFD, IRS，radio transmitter, 
MFD, antenna, 
Once before flight, I found the altimeter on the left side didn’t work. I checked MEL. 
According to MEL, I can continue the flight with this problem.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>092.<audio src="audio5/092.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Let’s suppose you lost your airborne weather radar, how would you report this to ATC?
 report to ATC, request latest weather reports from ATC and from other aircraft. If 
there’s bad weather along my route, weather radar malfunction is a serious problem, 
we’ll request landing as soon as possible. If the weather is good along the route, 
continue flight to the destination.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>093.<audio src="audio5/093.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If your autopilot cannot be connected, can you tell me the difference regarding cockpit 
task-sharing?
 The captain takes control of the aircraft, the copilot does the radio and the checklists.
If the rest of the flight is more than two hours, the crew may decide to divert to the alternate, 
because the disconnected autopilot increase the workload greatly. If the flight is less 
than 2 hours, the crew member should take turns to control the aircraft to fly to the 
destination.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>094.<audio src="audio5/094.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Have you heard about any accidents of runway incursion?/ Have you encountered 
runway incursion?/
 I know a very typical accident of runway incursion. It happened in Tenerife. KLM flight 
started takeoff rolling on the runway before the pilot received takeoff clearance, while 
another a/c, PanAm flight hasn’t vacated the runway. As a result, two a/c collided on the 
runway, more than 500 people died in this accident.
 for example, a few days ago, at Hongqiao Airport, two aircraft, both from China Eastern, 
almost collided on the runway. A 320 was taking off, while another aircraft, a A330 was 
crossing the runway. Lucikliy the pilot of A320 made the right decision, he continued 
takeoff, used the full power and pulled up the aircraft, and the A320 just flew over A330. 
I think controller should be responsible for this incident, he should not let the aircraft 
enter the runway when anther aircraft is taking off..

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>095.<audio src="audio5/095.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What are typical examples of runway incursion?
 An aircraft is taking off while another is crossing the active runway, or a ground vehicle 
is working on the runway.
 an airplane is not clear of runway while the other is landing or a vehicle occupies the 
runway.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>096.<audio src="audio5/096.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What might be the reasons for runway incursion?
 low visibility, intersecting runways, non-standard phraseology, language barrier, heavy 
workload, human errors, conditional clearance(behind Air China on final)
 human error: pilot’s failure to follow ATC’s instructions, 
 ATC gives incorrect clearance, non-standard radio communication. 
 before taking off or entering the runway, if the pilots don’t confirm with ATC, it may 
increase risks of runway incursion.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>097.<audio src="audio5/097.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What can a pilot do to avoid runway incursion?
 Use standard words, speak slowly and clearly, follow ATC instructions, be familiar with 
taxi routes. If unsure of position, stop the a/c and confirm with ATC, carry out crosscheck. 
When unsure of ATC’s instructions, confirm with ATC.
 Before entering the runway, we should confirm with ATC and observe other traffic. 
Before landing, we should monitor reports from other aircraft and controllers. we 
should be familiar with the taxi routes to avoid taking the runway as taxiway.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>098.<audio src="audio5/098.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Have you ever heard about any incidents concerning tail strike?
 An accident happened last week in my airline. The pilot encountered turbulence during 
landing, he decided to go around, and made the second attempt. But in his second 
landing, he pitched up a little more, as a result, tail part hit the ground.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>099.<audio src="audio5/099.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What might be the reasons for tail strike?
 Strong wind, improper use of flight control(Low speed and great pitch during landing or 
takeoff), incorrect pitch, miscalculation of CG , incorrect input to FMS. Wake turbulence.


</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>100.<audio src="audio5/100.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What can be done to avoid tail strike?
 If there’s strong wind, delay takeoff or approach. Double check when input the 
information into FMC. Pilots should improve flying skills. Follow standard takeoff and 
landing procedures, make more practice of takeoff and landing in simulator training.
 for example , we should avoid wake turbulence. if there is a heavy aircraft just taking-off, 
we need to keep separation with the preceding aircraft.
