							<tr><td>101.<audio src="audio5/101.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>  Could you tell me something about ATIS?
18
 ATIS stands for automatic terminal information service. It is updated at least once an 
hour, and in alphabetic sequence, such as A\B\C. If the weather changes in airport, it is 
updated more often.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>102.<audio src="audio5/102.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What information is included?
 It includes weather information and airport conditions. Weather information includes 
visibility, wind, dew point, temperature, cloud, QNH. Airport conditions include runway 
in use, approach type, and so on. It also includes some important information, like bird 
activities, working project near the runway or taxiway.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>103.<audio src="audio5/103.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> When and where do you need to copy\listen to ATIS?
 We usually listen to ATIS before departure and approach.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>104.<audio src="audio5/104.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Do you think ATIS is useful？
 Yes, it is very useful, especially for takeoff and landing. For example, if the wind is 
strong, we need to make some correction to control the aircraft. And the pilot can 
copy information changes in time, such as runway change and visibility.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>105.<audio src="audio5/105.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If you fly next day, will you make preparation today?/How would you prepare for your flight the day before?
Yes, I will make some preparations the day before the flight. Good preparation is always 
necessary. In our company, if I fly next day, I will log in company’s FLIGHT 
PREPARATION NET PAGE. We call it on line preparation.
During the preparation, we need to know flight schedule, crew members, NOTAM, 
weather conditions, alternate airport and so on.
Before each flight, we need to complete a brief test on the internet. There are 10 
questions about regulations and flight rules. It usually takes me at least 30 minutes to 
prepare on line. 
The day before my flight training, I need to get familiar with/ review my training subjects. 
The training subjects include traffic patterns, how to make maneuvers, the procedures for 
instrument approach, the procedures under different situations, especially emergency 
situations, for example, flapless landing, engine failure during initial climb.
I should also review some important data for the subjects. For example, speed 
limitations, the rotation speed for takeoff is 59 knots.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>106.<audio src="audio5/106.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What do you usually do in the briefing room before you board the aircraft for a flight?
Every crew member signs in when they enter the briefing room. We get a folder from 
dispatcher, including NOTAM, flight plan and weather. There’s always a short meeting 
19
among the crew members before each flight. The captain will give a briefing to every 
crew member. We discuss the weather, alternate airport, schedule, task sharing, security 
issues. We discuss the procedures in case of hijack. For example, the secret signal among 
the crew members in case of hijack. We will review one of emergency procedures, for 
example, engine failure before V1.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>107.<audio src="audio5/107.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If you find something abnormal during your pre-flight system check, what would you do?
 I’ll ask the maintenance people to have a check. If they cannot make the decision, they 
will check MEL to decide whether to continue the flight with this aircraft or change 
another aircraft.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>108.<audio src="audio5/108.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Whose responsibility is it to perform the walk-around inspection for every flight?
The captain. According to our flight manual, the pilot-in-command has responsibility to 
perform walk-around inspection. Sometimes, the first officer will perform the 
walk-around inspection, too. 
(According to our company’s regulation, it’s the captain’s responsibility to perform the 
walk-around inspection, after captain completes the inspection, he may ask FO to double 
check.)

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>109.<audio src="audio5/109.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Is there a specific route for a walk-around inspection? What is it? What is the purpose of 
it?
 Yes, there is. Pilots start from the left forward cabin door, and then walk around the 
aircraft in clockwise direction. This route for walk-around inspection is specified in SOP.
 The purpose is to make sure the pilots won’t miss any important part and improve work 
efficiency.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>110.<audio src="audio5/110.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Which parts do you think need to be checked carefully? And why?
We need to check the engine very carefully. We check the air inlet to see if there are any 
foreign objects in it. If there are foreign objects in the engine, it may cause engine 
flameout. 
We also check pitot tube and static port to make sure it is not blocked. If they are 
blocked, instrument display, like airspeed, altitude may not be correct.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>111.<audio src="audio5/111.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>When you are performing the walk-around inspection in an extremely cold weather, is 
there anything that you need to be careful about?
In the winter, there could be ice buildup on the wings and fuselage. Icing build up on the 
wings may reduce aircraft performance and lift, so I need to perform de-icing.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>112.<audio src="audio5/112.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What may cause a pilot to reject takeoff?
Many situations can cause takeoff rejection(takeoff rejection may be caused by, there 
are many reasons for takeoff rejection) such as wind shear, systems failure, bird strike, 
configuration warning, engine fire, engine flameout, and some significant incidents 
affecting flight safety, like runway incursion, incapacitated pilot and so on. If the speed is 
before V1, the pilot must reject take off.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>113.<audio src="audio5/113.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What will you do when the warning alerts are triggered during takeoff?
That depends.
If the speed is below 100 knots, the aircraft encounters problems, like configuration 
warning, system failure, burst tire, we should abort takeoff.
If the speed is between 100knots and V1, the aircraft encounters problems like fire 
warning, engine failure, wind shear warning, or any situations pilots think will endanger 
flight safety, pilots must reject takeoff. 
If the speed is over V1, but the warning alerts are triggered, the pilots still have to 
continue takeoff.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>114.<audio src="audio5/114.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What are the procedures for rejecting takeoff?
 If the speed is below V1 and the captain makes the decision to reject takeoff，he should 
call out “stop”, then set the throttle to idle, apply maximum brake, deploy speed brake 
and thrust reverser. He should keep the aircraft nose along the runway centerline. When 
the aircraft is stopped, report to ATC and make an announcement to passengers.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>115.<audio src="audio5/115.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What is the task sharing during rejected takeoff?
The captain makes the decision. He calls out ‘stop’ and says ‘I have control’. Then he 
takes immediate actions to stop the aircraft. He uses maximum brake and thrust reverser to 
reduce speed, and uses the rudder pedals to control direction. If there is strong crosswind, 
FO should help the captain keep the direction of the aircraft.
And the FO confirm the throttle is in idle position, read the speed indication. When the 
aircraft is stopped, the FO contacts ATC while the captain makes an announcement to 
passengers.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>116.<audio src="audio5/116.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What are the possible consequences of rejecting takeoff after V1?
If we reject takeoff after V1, there isn’t enough distance for our aircraft to fully stop on 
the runway. We may not have enough time to take actions and perform aborted takeoff 
procedures. The aircraft will get out of/overrun the runway. That will cause severe 
damage to the a/c and passenger injuries. So we must takeoff after V1.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>117.<audio src="audio5/117.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Are there any technical manuals or handbooks in your cockpit? Can you name a few?
Operation manuals, QRH, MEL, performance manuals

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>118.<audio src="audio5/118.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Do you often consult these manuals in flight? Are they convenient to use?
Yes. For example, QRH can help us deal with the problem, when we encounter abnormal 
situations.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>119.<audio src="audio5/119.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Do you know about MEL? What does it stand for?
It stands for minimum equipment list.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>120.<audio src="audio5/120.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What is MEL used for? Is it important for flight safety? Why?
Before start-up engines/ taxi, if we find something abnormal, we check MEL. If it’s a minor 
problem, we just continue the flight. If it’s a major problem, we need to change another 
aircraft. 
The maintenance use MEL to release/clear the a/c. 
According to MEL, We can fly with some minor problems. 
MEL tells/ shows/indicates what should the flight crew and mechanics do in terms of these 
problems./ to deal with the problems.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>121.<audio src="audio5/121.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Is it possible that these paper manuals be replaced by the electronic files?
Yes. With the development of technology, everyone can use computer to review/get 
information. Electronic files are easy/convenient to read, to carry, to keep for a long time, to 
update. It’s easy to update these manuals. It can reduce cost and save resource.
Maybe part of them will be replaced by the electronic files. I think it is necessary to keep the 
standby in case of electronic failure.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>122.<audio src="audio5/122.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Could you introduce your Normal Checklist to use? When do you use your Normal 
Checklist? What are included in your normal checklist?
 In my opinion, normal checklist is the standard items for normal operation. It is used in 
every phase (stage) of the normal flight./ We use Normal checklist at different phases of 
the flight. 
 Normal checklist includes pre-flight checklist, before start-up checklist, before taxi 
checklist, before and after takeoff checklist, descent and approach checklist, before 
landing checklist and so on.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>123.<audio src="audio5/123.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>How do the flight crew members cooperate with each other to carry out the checklist procedures?
on the ground, the FO does the checklist and the captain confirms. During cruising, in 
normal situations, PM does the checklist and PF confirms. In abnormal situations, the 
captain will take control. 
 first, PF calls out the checklist, then PM reads and does the checklist procedure. At the 
same time, the PF confirms and monitors his action.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>124.<audio src="audio5/124.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Do you think QRH is useful? Why?/ What is the purpose(目的) of QRH?
Because QRH includes normal checklist，abnormal checklist，aircraft performance and 
maneuver flight, so it’s very useful for pilots. It’s easy to use, especially in emergency 
situations, the pilots don’t have to remember so many items. Pilots follow QRH to deal 
with the problem step by step.
The main purpose of QRH is to remind pilots of relevant procedures. As a result, it 
reduces human errors and increases efficiency. 
QRH can help pilots make quick response, and solve the problems effectively. For 
example, if we encounter low oil pressure, hydraulic fluid leak, we can follow QRH to 
deal with the problem. So it can help ensure flight safety/ increase safety margin.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>125.<audio src="audio5/125.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What’s the use of loading sheet? What kinds of information are included in the loading 
sheet?
With the loading sheet, pilots can know the weight and CG of the aircraft so that they 
can calculate takeoff data. It’s used for weight and balance control. Without it, the 
aircraft cannot take off.
For example, we need to enter some important data like zero fuel weight, takeoff 
weight into FMC, we will know the important speed during takeoff, like V1, Vr, V2. 
We get CG, takeoff weight, landing weight, fuel on board. With the data, we can 
calculate the takeoff speed, landing speed. (student pilots)
The loading sheet includes Flight number, number of pax, the weight of cargo, baggage 
and post, zero fuel weight, center of gravity, takeoff weight, takeoff fuel weight, landing 
weight, stabilizer trim unit…

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>126.<audio src="audio5/126.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> How do you get the loading sheet?
 The company sends us the loading sheet by ACARS, or the ground staff send it by 
themselves.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>127.<audio src="audio5/127.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Which department is responsible for providing the loading sheet to flight crew?
 operational center； Weight and balance office

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>128.<audio src="audio5/128.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Have you ever received any training concerning dangerous goods transportation? What 
was involved in training? What have you learned?
 Yes, we have dangerous goods training once every two years. We learn a lot from the 
training, including regulations and operational policies about dangerous goods 
transportation; classification of dangerous goods; packing, labeling and marking; and 
actions to be taken in case of emergency.
 There are nine types of dangerous goods, like flammable, explosives.
 We learn a lot from the training, including regulations about dangerous goods 
transportation. we learn the requirements for carrying lithium batteries. (we can only put it 
in the hand baggage, not in the checked baggage) We learn the actions to be taken in case of 
fire. For example, if the battery is on fire, we should use plenty of water to extinguish.
What can be considered as dangerous goods. We learn how to deal with the problem in case 
of dangerous goods leakage or on fire.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>129.<audio src="audio5/129.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What topics do you discuss during dangerous goods training? Give me an example.
 We learn a lot from the training, including regulations and operational policies about 
dangerous goods transportation; classification of dangerous goods; packing, labeling 
and marking; and procedures in case of emergency.
for example, We learn regulations about dangerous goods transportation. we learn the 
requirements for carrying lithium batteries. (we can only put it in the hand baggage, not 
in the checked baggage) We learn the actions to be taken in case of fire. For example, if 
the battery is on fire, we should use plenty of water to distinguish.
 We learn how to deal with the problem in case of dangerous goods 
 leakage or on fire.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>130.<audio src="audio5/130.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Have you ever had dangerous goods training? How often?
 Yes. according to CAAC’s regulations, pilots should receive dangerous goods training 
once every two years.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>131.<audio src="audio5/131.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If there’s a leakage of a dangerous liquid substance in flight, what would you do?
 This situation is very dangerous, which can cause fire or other serious consequences. If 
the leakage causes smoke, acrid smell or fire, we must perform the emergency 
procedure, for example, release the extinguisher to put out the fire, and report to ATC 
and operations, and land as soon as possible, request fire services upon arrival. Confirm 
with ATC of airport rescue and fire facility category. Consider emergency evacuation 
after landing.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>132.<audio src="audio5/132.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Please name a few dangerous goods.
 Denatured alcohol, battery fluid, fireworks, oxygen, dry ice, paint, lighters, weapons, 
radioactive materials
 flammable, explosives, erosive, radioactive, toxic

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>133.<audio src="audio5/133.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What are considered as dangerous goods in aviation? Give me an example.
There are nine types of dangerous goods, like flammable, explosives, toxics, erosive, 
radioactive.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>134.<audio src="audio5/134.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Does your airline provide guidelines for identifying or handling of dangerous goods? Do 
you think it is necessary? Why?/ Are you familiar with the procedures to identify or handle 
dangerous goods?
 Yes. we have Dangerous Goods Transportation Manual and Dangerous Goods Training 
Program. They are useful and provide us guidance to deal with problems concerned 
dangerous goods transportation.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>135.<audio src="audio5/135.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Are lithium batteries dangerous goods? What threats may they likely bring to flight safety?
Yes. because they may easily cause fire or explosion during transportation. The fire is 
quite difficult to be put out, which may lead to serious consequences.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>136.<audio src="audio5/136.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Do you like in-flight catering?
Yes, because there are many kinds of food for pilots, and they are delicious. 
No, the food is terrible. I get very tired of it, because it’s always the same.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>137.<audio src="audio5/137.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Do you have the same food with the captain/FO on board?
No. according to regulations, the captain and the F/O cannot eat the same kind of food 
at the same time. 
If the pilot eats something bad or poisonous, he may become incapacitated or 
unconscious, it will endanger flight safety.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>138.<audio src="audio5/138.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Do you think the security check on the catering staff is necessary? Why?
 Yes, it’s very necessary, because according to CAAC regulations, every person who 
wants to get on board must go through security check to ensure safety.
 Prevent smuggling, drug-trafficking, terrorist activities, illegal immigration and so on.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>139.<audio src="audio5/139.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What does SOP stand for?
SOP stands for standard operation procedures.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>140.<audio src="audio5/140.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What are the basic objectives of SOPs?
The objective of SOP is to set standards and make pilots complete their works according to 
the same standard, which can help prevent human errors.
For example, we encounter abnormal situations, we don’t know what we should do, we 
should follow SOP, which can help us make right decision.
The same type of aircraft has the same SOP. Pilots flying B737 follow the same SOP, 
although they may come from different airlines.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>141.<audio src="audio5/141.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Do you believe SOPs are effective methods to prevent human errors? Why?
Yes, I think so. SOP tells pilots what should be done at certain time and certain places.
All pilots use the same procedures, which can help reduce misunderstandings among crew 
members in flight operations. For example, if the crew members have different opinion 
about diversion, they should check SOP, which can help them make right decision.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>142.<audio src="audio5/142.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What might happen if SOPs are not followed?
If SOPs are not followed, it may cause human errors or even aviation accidents.
For example, Yichun Accident. Because the pilot didn’t strictly follow SOP, the aircraft 
crashed. During approach, the weather was below minimum. According to SOP, the pilot 
should go around, but the pilot continued to make approach and landing. In the end, the 
a/c crashed on the mountain.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>143.<audio src="audio5/143.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What training does your company provide to address and improve strict adherence to 
SOPs? 
 Our airline will inspect the compliance of SOP in every simulator training, ground 
training and upgrade training.
 In these trainings, the airline’s inspectors will check if the pilots comply with SOP in 
flying. Through the continuous(constant) training and inspection, SOP has become an 
important part of the pilots work, and SOP has become pilots’ habit.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>144.<audio src="audio5/144.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What measures does your company take to ensure the compliance of SOPs?
 Pilots have handbook of SOPs in the cockpit, they can consult SOP if they encounter 
problems during flight.
 If the pilots fail to follow SOPs, it will be recorded in QAR. 
 if any incident occurs, after the flight, Check voice –recording to see if the pilots use 
standard call. 
 Sometimes pilots may fail to follow SOP during flight operation. But after the flight, 
when he reviews flight procedures, he will realize his incompliance of SOP almost causes 
a serious mistake.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>145.<audio src="audio5/145.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What factors may cause a/c to overrun the r/w after landing?
 There are many reasons for the aircraft to be out of runway. Reject takeoff around V1, 
braking action poor due to slippery runway, gear up landing, overweight landing, 
tailwind and crosswind, flapless landing, above the glide slope, unstable approach,

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>146.<audio src="audio5/146.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Have you ever experienced taking off or landing on the short and narrow runways?
When I had initial flight training in flight school, we operated at a small airport. The runway is 
less than 2200 meters. But I flew a small training aircraft, the runway is long enough for 
landing and takingoff.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>147.<audio src="audio5/147.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What kind of runway may be considered as short and narrow runway?
 Generally speaking, if the runway is less than 2500meters long and/or less than 
45meters wide, it may be considered as short and narrow runway. 
 Most runways at our airports are longer than 2500 meters and wider than 60 meters. 
But different types of aircraft have different requirements for the runway length and 
width. If it is an A380, the runway must be longer than 3000 meters. 
 If the runway is at the high elevation airport, it must be longer, because the aircraft 
performance will be lower and ground speed is higher, aircraft needs longer runway for 
takeoff and landing.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>148.<audio src="audio5/148.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Are there any risks when pilots operate on short and narrow runway? What are they? / 
Do you think it’s dangerous to operate on ….?
 The aircraft may overrun or veer off the runway.
 Another risk is that for the big aircraft like A330, the wing span is large, if the runway 
width is less than 60 meters, engines may extend out of the runway, as a result, 
foreign objects, like debris may be sucked into the engines. 
 Another threat is that operation on the short and narrow r/w may easily cause pilots’
visual illusion. Sometimes pilots think that their aircraft is above glide slope, which is not 
true. As a result, the pilots fly the aircraft lower than glide path, which threatens flight 
safety.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>149.<audio src="audio5/149.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>What should a pilot do to ensure safe landing on a short and narrow runway?
During final approach, pilots should pay attention to descent profile. Pilots have to follow 
vertical guidance and they should align the aircraft with glide slope, not above the glide 
slope. (The aircraft must be aligned with glide slope.)
Use maximum brake and thrust reverser
Another problem is that operation on the short and narrow r/w may easily cause pilots visual 
illusion, so pilots have to rely on their instruments.
