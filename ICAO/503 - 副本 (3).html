							<tr><td>101.<audio src="audio5/101.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>  Could you tell me something about ATIS?
18
 ATIS stands for automatic terminal information service. It is updated at least once an 
hour, and in alphabetic sequence, such as A\B\C. If the weather changes in airport, it is 
updated more often.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>102.<audio src="audio5/102.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What information is included?
 It includes weather information and airport conditions. Weather information includes 
visibility, wind, dew point, temperature, cloud, QNH. Airport conditions include runway 
in use, approach type, and so on. It also includes some important information, like bird 
activities, working project near the runway or taxiway.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>103.<audio src="audio5/103.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> When and where do you need to copy\listen to ATIS?
 We usually listen to ATIS before departure and approach.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>104.<audio src="audio5/104.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Do you think ATIS is useful？
 Yes, it is very useful, especially for takeoff and landing. For example, if the wind is 
strong, we need to make some correction to control the aircraft. And the pilot can 
copy information changes in time, such as runway change and visibility.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>105.<audio src="audio5/105.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If you fly next day, will you make preparation today?/How would you prepare for your flight the day before?
Yes, I will make some preparations the day before the flight. Good preparation is always 
necessary. In our company, if I fly next day, I will log in company’s FLIGHT 
PREPARATION NET PAGE. We call it on line preparation.
During the preparation, we need to know flight schedule, crew members, NOTAM, 
weather conditions, alternate airport and so on.
Before each flight, we need to complete a brief test on the internet. There are 10 
questions about regulations and flight rules. It usually takes me at least 30 minutes to 
prepare on line. 
The day before my flight training, I need to get familiar with/ review my training subjects. 
The training subjects include traffic patterns, how to make maneuvers, the procedures for 
instrument approach, the procedures under different situations, especially emergency 
situations, for example, flapless landing, engine failure during initial climb.
I should also review some important data for the subjects. For example, speed 
limitations, the rotation speed for takeoff is 59 knots.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>106.<audio src="audio5/106.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> What do you usually do in the briefing room before you board the aircraft for a flight?
Every crew member signs in when they enter the briefing room. We get a folder from 
dispatcher, including NOTAM, flight plan and weather. There’s always a short meeting 
19
among the crew members before each flight. The captain will give a briefing to every 
crew member. We discuss the weather, alternate airport, schedule, task sharing, security 
issues. We discuss the procedures in case of hijack. For example, the secret signal among 
the crew members in case of hijack. We will review one of emergency procedures, for 
example, engine failure before V1.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>107.<audio src="audio5/107.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> If you find something abnormal during your pre-flight system check, what would you do?
 I’ll ask the maintenance people to have a check. If they cannot make the decision, they 
will check MEL to decide whether to continue the flight with this aircraft or change 
another aircraft.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>108.<audio src="audio5/108.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Whose responsibility is it to perform the walk-around inspection for every flight?
The captain. According to our flight manual, the pilot-in-command has responsibility to 
perform walk-around inspection. Sometimes, the first officer will perform the 
walk-around inspection, too. 
(According to our company’s regulation, it’s the captain’s responsibility to perform the 
walk-around inspection, after captain completes the inspection, he may ask FO to double 
check.)

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>109.<audio src="audio5/109.mp3" controls></audio><br><a> Is there a specific route for a walk-around inspection? What is it? What is the purpose of 
it?
 Yes, there is. Pilots start from the left forward cabin door, and then walk around the 
aircraft in clockwise direction. This route for walk-around inspection is specified in SOP.
 The purpose is to make sure the pilots won’t miss any important part and improve work 
efficiency.

</a><br><br></td></tr>		<tr><td>110.<audio src="audio5/110.mp3" controls></audio><br><a>Which parts do you think need to be checked carefully? And why?
We need to check the engine very carefully. We check the air inlet to see if there are any 
foreign objects in it. If there are foreign objects in the engine, it may cause engine 
flameout. 
We also check pitot tube and static port to make sure it is not blocked. If they are 
blocked, instrument display, like airspeed, altitude may not be correct.
